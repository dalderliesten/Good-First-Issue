This expects static children as additional arguments to the constructor
and flattens any array arguments one level deep.

Component(props, child1, child2, arrayOfChildren, child3) ->
.props.children = [child1, child2, ...arrayOfChildren, child3]

This can avoid an additional heap allocation for the unflat array.

It allows you to pass nested arrays and objects like you used to. Those
aren't immediately flattened. That makes this a fairly safe change.

Passing a dynamic array without key properties will yield a warning
(once). Might consider throwing later.

a single flat array in normal usage.

If several children complete leaving before rendering TransitionGroup,
only the last one was removed. This could easily happen if
callback in componentWillLeave is called synchronously and several items
are removed from array. The other case is when ReactCSSTransitionGroup
has transitionLeave={false} and array is also cleaned up.

The bug was happening because this.state.children was used as a base for
children removal and it wasn't updated until the render, so only the last
removal was actually happening.

Fix involves keeping the updated children state between invocations of
_handleDoneLeaving. After updating this.state and rendering,
updatedState is cleaned up and ready for subsequent array modifications.

Update links to use https:// where it is supported. There's probably a lot
more that could be fixed, but these are the core ones I found (especially
the download links in order to prevent MITM attacks). Note that there are
some fb.me links that will redirect to http:// even while accessed over
https://, but this seemed like the best way to fix those for now.

NOTE: Only non-third-party files were modified. There are references to
http:// URLs in vendored/third-party files, but seems appropriate to fix
upstream for those rather than editing the files.

Also, copy one image locally to the blog, as it was hotlinking to a site

As discussed in issue 1326
(https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1326) transitionend events are
unreliable; they may not fire because the element is no longer painted,
the browser tab is no longer focused or for a range of other reasons.
This is particularly harmful during leave transitions since the leaving
element will be permanently stuck in the DOM (and possibly visible).

The ReactCSSTransitionGroup now requires timeouts to be passed in
explicitly for each type of animation. Omitting the timeout duration
for a transition now triggers a PropTypes warning with a link to the
updated documentation.",djrodgerspryor,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/6bd6ef208b302879eb38018d4192a054f40c1c8b

otto, and any other JS implementation that may not be fully compliant on

3c980aaf3018b7deed03584a548c3b76cbee4910,"Type EventPluginRegistry

This commit takes the first incremental step towards adding type checks
to the React event code. A couple of issues came up.

There is an issue with the SyntheticEvent type: Flow declares a
SyntheticEvent type[1] that lacks the non-public properties which are
used in React internals. To solve this I declared a class that extends
SyntheticEvent. This class can be expanded as we add Flow types to more
places where SyntheticEvent instances are referenced.

I'm happy to change this if folks prefer a different approach.
Some options I considered:
- Override the SyntheticEvent declaration with our own declaration
  - Pro: We can use 'SyntheticEvent' as a type just like we are used to
    when working in any other codebase.
  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration
  - Pro: Only one version of SyntheticEvent; less confusion.
  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.
  - Con: Duplicates part of the type declared in Flow.
- Import the SyntheticEvent class and use that as the type
  - Pro: Keeps type definition in sync with the real implementation.
  - Con: Declaration overrides implementation so I'm not sure this would
    work.
  - Con: Have to remember to import the type.
- Declare a separate type called ReactSyntheticEvent that extends
  SyntheticEvent
  - Pro: Stays in sync with the Flow SyntheticEvent type;
    less duplication.
  - Pro: Differentiates this type from the Flow SyntheticEvent type;
    less confusion.
  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration
  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.

I also ran into an issue where a variable was only non-null when
'__DEV__' is true, similar to PR #7586.[2] The work-around is to force
it to be typed non-null and add a comment documenting the reason. At
this time Flow doesn't have a better way to deal with the situation.

Next steps:
- Specific type for the 'dispatchConfig' property of SyntheticEvent
- More detailed types for PluginName and PluginModule

Lastly; note that I renamed some variables to follow the convention of
reserving PascalCase for classes, enums, and Flow types.

I believe what was meant here was to express that you would create the new player object with all the previous properties of the existing player object in addition to now updating the score value. That being said, this is a simple example, and the player object clearly has no other values. Objects are not (by default) iterable using this operator, so this little piece does more harm than good. I believe the new example to be much clearer.

I want to propose some changes to the Refs and the DOM documentation page. 
- Make it clear that string refs are legacy. It seems that this information got lost during the transition to new docs and only some part stayed the same, which was confusing when first reading the docs.
- Clarify and explain that during render, if the ref callback is provided, it will get called twice, first with `null` and then with the rendered DOM element. Discussed in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4533 and first proposed docs change in PR #8333.

I've also planned on adding an example for passing the refs up the component chain based on something I've needed to solve myself (e.g. you want to connect two dynamic components by line in React, so you need to both use refs and propagate them up the chain), and while it would be great to read up on this in the docs, it may be too specific for this section; I'd be happy to hear any recommendations.

This behavior will get users into trouble in JSX because a quoted attribute is always treated as a string literal, even if it contains curly-braced javascript code.  Let's add to the docs to help newbies evade this problem.

* Removed optimization for events without target in ReactNativeEventEmitter

This PR fixes the problem originally introduced in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6590
The problem is that `ResponderEventPlugin` (and `ResponderTouchHistoryStore`) relies on that fact that touch events are balanced.
So if one `startish` event happened, should be coming `endish` event. Otherwise there is no way to maintain internal `trackedTouchCount` counter. So, if we drop some events, we break this logic.

Moreover, that optimization clearly contradict with this statement from `ResponderEventPlugin`:
```
We must be resilient to `targetInst` being `null` on `touchMove` or
`touchEnd`. On certain platforms, this means that a native scroll has
assumed control and the original touch targets are destroyed.
```

This issue causes several major problems in React Native, and one of them (finally!) is easy to reproduce: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12976 .

The test also illustrates this problem.

In case anybody else stumbles across this old blog post, I wanted to submit a patch to help with unhandled rejections.  

`#then` and `#catch` each return new Promise instances, so here we actually create two new promises (that aren't assigned).  If the argument promise to `#makeCancelable` rejects, the promise created by `#then` will be an unhandled rejection, which in Node 7 will be an uncaught error.

setTimeout and clearTimeout may not be available in some server-render environments (such as ChakraCore in React.NET), and loading ReactScheduler.js will cause a crash unless the existence of the variables are checked via a typeof comparison.

061d6ce3c0310d3b7f2122ad216be01bc4eff956,"fix(react-dom): access iframe contentWindow instead of contentDocument (#15099)

MDN has a list of methods for obtaining the window reference of an
iframe:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage#Syntax

fix(react-dom): check if iframe belongs to the same origin

Accessing the contentDocument of a HTMLIframeElement can cause the browser
to throw, e.g. if it has a cross-origin src attribute.
Safari will show an error in the console when the access results in ""Blocked a frame with origin"". e.g:

```javascript
try {
 $0.contentDocument.defaultView
} catch (err) {
  console.log('err', err)
}

> Blocked a frame with origin X from accessing a frame with origin Y. Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
> err – TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating '$0.contentDocument.defaultView')
```

A safety way is to access one of the cross origin properties: Window or Location
Which might result in ""SecurityError"" DOM Exception and it is compatible to Safari.

```javascript
try {
 $0.contentWindow.location.href
} catch (err) {
 console.log('err', err)
}

> err – SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin ""http://localhost:3001"" from accessing a cross-origin frame. Protocols, domains, and ports must match.

* [react-native] Use path-based imports instead of Haste for the RN renderer

To move React Native to standard path-based imports instead of Haste, the RN renderer that is generated from the code in this repo needs to use path-based imports as well since the generated code is vendored by RN. This commit makes it so the interface between the generated renderers and RN does not rely on Haste and instead uses a private interface explicitly defined by RN. This inverts control of the abstraction so that RN decides the internals to export rather than React deciding what to import.

On RN's side, a new module named `react-native/Libraries/ReactPrivate/ReactNativePrivateInterface` explicitly exports the modules used by the renderers in this repo. (There is also a private module for InitializeCore so that we can import it just for the side effects.) On React's side, the various renderer modules access RN internals through the explicit private interface.

The Rollup configuration becomes slimmer since the only external package is now `react-native`, and the individual modules are instead listed out in `ReactNativePrivateInterface`.

Task description: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24770
Sister RN PR (needs to land before this one): https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24782

Test Plan: Ran unit tests and Flow in this repo. Generated the renderers and manually copied them over to the RN repo. Ran the RN tests and launched the RNTester app.

* Access natively defined ""nativeFabricUIManager"" instead of importing it

Some places in the Fabric renderers access `nativeFabricUIManager` (a natively defined global) instead of importing UIManager. While this is coupling across repos that depends on the timing of events, it is necessary until we have a way to defer top-level imports to run after `nativeFabricUIManager` is defined.
