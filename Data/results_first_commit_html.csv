Before this change, the content security policy of ImageBitmap did not
allow any cross-origin content in ImageBitmap objects. Attempts to do
so would cause SecurityError exceptions to be thrown. With this
change, a tainting mechanism is added to ImageBitmap, which allows
cross-origin content to be transported by ImageBitmaps while still
protecting the bitmap image data from being accessed by script. The
tainting mechanism uses an 'origin clean' flag that works much like
the 'origin clean' flag of canvas element bitmaps.

Some external links augment the current document and should not be

a prefetch link within body content based on the generated content (well

Similarly, the position of a rel=stylesheet link in body can act as an
optimization and signal to the user agent that DOM content above it may
be painted - see [1]. However, note that this update does not define or
change how or when CSS is applied - that's a separate discussion.

99614e46cb756789dfb5db5d164580ad862fbaa5,"Fix confusable same site examples

The results shown in the example table for ""same site"" and ""schemelessly
same site"" algorithms are based on assuming that ""suffix.example"" is a
public suffix. Since it actually isn't, this causes confusion.

This commit replaces ""suffix.example"" with ""wildlife.museum"" which is a
valid public suffix from the Public Suffix List
(https://publicsuffix.org). It also explicitly states all of the public
suffixes involved in the examples.
