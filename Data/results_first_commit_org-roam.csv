If the org-roam buffer is already in org-mode, don't try to re-enable
it (since this essentially turns org-mode hooks into post-command-hooks
and can be computationally expensive).",ryjm,https://api.github.com/repos/jethrokuan/org-roam/git/commits/e3b0b3b64da63cf6520204c072629ac50111abe0

570467b34b3dcb8f23cd3411b63c2ee2f40bf6cf,"(internal): increase performance of post-command-hook (#122)

file-truename can be an expensive function on a slow filesystem like NFS. I Removed a lot of the unneeded code and refactored to improve performance. In my testing it took the execution time from 13ms per call to 2Âµs; over a 1000x speedup. This is important since post-command-hook is called with every character you type.",CeleritasCelery,https://api.github.com/repos/jethrokuan/org-roam/git/commits/570467b34b3dcb8f23cd3411b63c2ee2f40bf6cf
