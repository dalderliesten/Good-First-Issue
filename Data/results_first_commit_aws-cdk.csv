6642ca2341716dcf0477ba774c621c11d6bef6aa,"feat(ecs): VPC link for API Gatweay and ECS services (#1541)

Overview
========
The primary purpose of this work is to fill in the gaps in
implementation for deploying a VPC link between API Gateway, and an
ECS service. My goal was to allow setting up a {proxy+} API which would
forward to a Fargate service in a private VPC.

This has been tagged as 'ecs', but also involves changes to api gateway.

Since VPC links require an NLB, the LoadBalanced{Fargate|Ecs}Service classes
have been modified to support selecting either an ALB or an NLB.

Changes
=======
On the APIGW side, `IntegrationOptions` now accepts an optional connetion
type enum, as well as a VpcLink. `VpcLink` itself is a new construct
which accepts an array of Network Load Balancers. I also added the missing
`requestParameters` prop for `Method`, to allow properly setting up a proxy
path variable.

For ECS, in my use case I wanted to use the LoadBalanced*Service constructs, however
they only supported ALB. I have pulled all of the ELBv2 related setup
into the new `LoadBalancedService` base class, and also created a base
props interface `LoadBalancedServiceProps`. This deals with the common setup
between the Fargate and ECS services, and allows the selection of ALB or NLB.
As a side-effect of this refactoring, you can also now pass a Certificate to
`LoadBalancedEcsService`.

There is a new `Method` test for the VPC link props, as well as new tests
for both `VpcLink` and `LoadBalancedFargateService`.",dotxlem,https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cdk/git/commits/6642ca2341716dcf0477ba774c621c11d6bef6aa

d0e19d50f5fc1459cea66b309aaa9fe18a3d9618,"feat(core+cli): support tagging of stacks (#2185)

Adding tags parameter option to cdk deploy command to allow tagging full stacks and their associated resources. 

Now it will be possible to:

```
const app = new App();

const stack1 = new Stack(app, 'stack1', { tags: { foo: 'bar' } });
const stack2 = new Stacl(app, 'stack2');

stack1.node.apply(new Tag('fii', 'bug'));
stack2.node.apply(new Tag('boo', 'bug'));
```
That will produce 
* stack1 with tags `foo bar` and `fii bug`
* stack2 with tags `boo bug`

It is possible also to override constructor tags with the stack.node.apply. 

So doing:
```
stack1.node.apply(new Tag('foo', 'newBar');
```
stack1 will have tags `foo newBar` and `fii bug`

Last, but not least, it is also possible to pass it via arguments (using yargs) as in the following example:

```
cdk deploy --tags foo=bar --tags myTag=myValue
```
That will produce a stack with tags `foo bar`and `myTag myValue`

**Important**
That will ignore tags provided by the constructor and/or aspects.

b8a1c8ecd016b91026d725177da77674a3c4e379,"fix(cloudformation-diff): string.replace error on `cdk context` (#2870)

`@aws-sdk/cloudformation-diff` depended on version `^2.1.1` of the `string-width`
library in `v0.28.0` of `aws-sdk`. In `v0.29.0`, the dependency was bumped to
`^4.1.0`, which inadvertently broke the `cdk context` command as reported
in: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk/issues/2854.

The current version of `string-width` executes a [string replacement](https://github.com/sindresorhus/string-width/commit/0bc308a2903c15087d187aa2069a12f8210f3eee#diff-168726dbe96b3ce427e7fedce31bb0bcR7), which ends up failing
when a non-string (such as the `int` row numbers of the `cdk context`
values). This did not previously occur, as the typecheck for `string`
would cause the function to return early and report zero-length.

The easiest solution here is to cast these values to `string`, which
has the beneficial side effect of ensuring that their character lengths
are taken into consideration rather than being defaulted to `0` as they
had previously been.

Security Groups are created with `allowAllOutbound: true` by default, and so imported security groups default to that as well. This means that no egress rules will be created for them, because that will undo the default of `allowAllOutbound`.

Given a project structure where the cdk (init) generated `node_modules` has a parent node project with its own `node_modules` folder with failing typescript code, the CDK will not compile because `tsc` traverses the directory structure looking for type definitions.

This small change adds the `typesRoot` [compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html#types-typeroots-and-types) essentially rooting the typescript compiler to look for types under the `cdk_root_folder/node_modules/@types`.",carlosrfernandez,https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cdk/git/commits/2c9bafa9458514905080223ed79ffe0d59699ba0

__WHY__
AWS CDK allows developers to attach subnets to other resource (e.g. ASG)

It is not possible to create subnet and attach it to ASG in same stack.

__WHAT__
The Subnet selection feature is expanded with ability to explicitly
define desired subnets. The subnet selection essentially becomes an
identity funnction.

If a proxy resource is added to the root, it will reflect any `addMethod` calls to the root resource, which causes two OPTIONS methods to be created when CORS is specified (one directly against the root resource and one by the proxy).

This uncovered a more general bug where if the proxy resource was added to the root, and the root already included a method of a certain kind, we will get a duplicate.

The fix is to avoid the proxy `addMethod` reflection on the root in case there is already a method by that type on the root.

It then consequently fails with

This PR adds functionality in aws-ecs-patterns to allow imported Network and Application load balancers to be used when initializing the LoadBalancedEC2Service and LoadBalancedFargateService constructs. By necessity, this means:

1) editing the Network and Application load balancer constructs to add an optional IVpc property to be used when calling the from<LBType>LoadBalancerAttributes static methods, and 
2) changing the error which is thrown when calling addTargets on imported load balancers. 

Unit tests are added in aws-ecs-patterns to test the new import functionality and in aws-elasticloadbalancingv2 to ensure that addTargets behaves properly when a Vpc is or is not specified for imported load balancers.

e5493bd2cea897a2d4e1576d3084e9fb2e9f6b7f,"feat(sns): support multiple tokens as url and email subscriptions (#6357)

fixes #3996 to allow using tokens in email subscriptions, additionally
fixes a bug with URL subscriptions when using more than one token
subscription.

**The Issue**
Email Subscriptions currently use the value passed in as the construct
ID, when the value passed in is a token (For example a parameter) it
causes an error as tokens aren't supported as construct IDs. A previous
fix was done for URL Subscriptions but it also errors when more than
one URL subscription with a token is used.

**The fix**
In the topic base, identify if the subscription ID is a token and
override it to a valid construct ID. The method of ensuring a valid ID
is to convert it to a special prefix suffixed by a number and doing an
increment of the number for each new topic created with a token.
Subscriptions not utilizing a token are not effected.

6bdd05d1bead3d1c8130196d04c96f5fa445ff95,"docs(apigateway): fixes typescript usage plan example (#6411)

Adds overall `throttle` setting to the example documentation on typescript CDK about how to use ""an API Key with a usage plan"". Without it, when trying to deploy the example code, it gives the following error:

```
Can not define fine grain throttling if usage plan throttle is not defined.
```

Before you can set individual throttle for each individual method, you need first to set the global throttle settings for that API. So adding the `throttle` parameter to the `addUsagePlan` method, with the same value as the individual throttle for the echoMethod, fixes it.

f8cacb9ae24ef7af45362a5212fddde351e67572,"fix(core): adds enableVersionUpgrade property to CfnUpdatePolicy (#6434)

When creating an Elasticsearch instance in the CDK, you are unable to
specify how the instance should be upgraded. This functionality is
present in CloudFormation, however it was missed in the CDK.

This fix adds the `enableVersionUpgrade` property to the CfnUpdatePolicy
interface.

Fixes: #6158

ee8f16936c0e5cb412fbdd0f210045261374dac9,"feat(aws-ec2): signal, download and execute helpers for UserData (#6029)

User Data objects currently only supports adding commands by providing the full command as a string.  This commit hopes to address this by adding the following functionality:
* On Exit Commands - Both bash and powershell have the concepts of trap functions which can be used to force a function to run when a an exception is run.  Using this we are able to set up a script block that will always run at the end of the script.
* add Signal Command - Using the above on Exit commands we are able to make it so the User data will send a signal to a specific resource (eg. Instance/Auto scaling group) with the results of the last command.
* Download S3 File Command - This adds commands to download the specified file using the aws cli on linux and AWS powershell  utility on windows
* Execute File Command - This adds commands to ensure that the specified file is executable then executes the file with specified arguments.
