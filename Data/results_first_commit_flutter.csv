-Add RenderParagraph and display:paragraph. This is the only
render type that's allowed to contain inlines or text.
-If you put text nodes directly in a non-paragraph, wrap them
in an anonymous paragraph. This may not be the place we want
to end up, but it's a good stopgap to make it so we don't
crash in this case.
-Make StyleAdjuster force that non-paragraph blocks only contain
RenderBlock subclasses and that paragraphs and inlines only contain
inlines.
-Considerably simplify addChildIgnoringAnonymousColumnBlocks
now that we only create anonymous blocks for the case of
text nodes in non-paragraphs. Also get rid of the behavior
where we try to group multiple nodes into a single

NOTE: This CL appears far larger than it actually is for two reasons:

1) Many files were moved around to use the Dart package directory structure.
2) Many .dart files had to have import paths updated.

- Organize mojo/public/dart so that it uses standard Dart package layout
- Organize mojo/dart/apptest so that it uses a standard Dart package layout
- Organize sky/sdk so that it uses a standard Dart package layout
- Create a mojo/testing package (used by unittests)
- Introduce the 'dart_pkg' gn rule which populates gen/Config/dart-pkg
- All internally vended Dart packages must have a corresponding dart_pkg rule
- It is now possible to use dependency_overrides: in pubspec.yaml to mix internal and external package dependencies (enables analyzer, editor, webstorm usage for internal developers).
- Package root for dart content handler ends with ""packages/""
- Imports of mojo package uris no longer need the ""public/dart""
- mojo/public/tools/dart_package.py is a clone of mojo/public/tools/gn/zip.py
- Sky tests no longer run 'deploy_sdk' script.

58163e0c39222a0697622831d5160d74c84f920c,"Rename springConstant to stiffness (#11686)

`stiffness` is the name of a spring's `k` input on [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/caspringanimation), [Android](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/preview/spring-animation.html), and the [Web](https://github.com/skevy/wobble/blob/bbc0f831e234f2d24fb905f2ec278c134d69ed68/src/index.js#L11-L22).  To ensure the API is familiar to and easily understood by developers coming from other platforms, Flutter should follow this convention as well.

This is a minimally-breaking change.  Across [all of GitHub](https://github.com/search?l=Dart&q=springConstant&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93), there are only 2 uses of the `springConstant` API (in Mondrian).  Those can be easily changed to use this name.

84f5b1cb09ea8c485fe11da686b5ceb7dfcf2660,"Round properly to nearest page in TabBarView. (#16868)

This logic is described in the test as looking for a scroll ending
very close to a new page, but in fact its behavior is more like
""very close to a page to the right"": if we're not very, very close
to any page, it will pick the page to the left, not an old page.

There's no reason this should be left-right asymmetrical.
Instead, pick the nearest page.

In practice, the case where this makes a difference never arises when
the scroll runs undisturbed to completion; but when the user taps on
the page to hold or drag, the scroll will be interrupted before it
gets within tolerance of a particular page, and this case does arise.

This fixes a glitch that is hard to trigger without time dilation,
but is quite conspicuous with it:

 * Open a tab view with at least 4 tabs, e.g. the Buttons screen
   of the gallery (with ""Animate Slowly"" on.)
 * Starting at tab 0, tap tab 2.
 * When the animation is nearly complete, tap the page a couple
   of times, as if to drag it around to scroll.  Then let the
   page view settle ballistically toward page 2.
 * Before it finishes, tap tab 3.
 * Suddenly page 1 fills the view, replacing page 2, before we
   scroll from there to page 3.

With this fix, the animation in the last step moves smoothly from
where we are when it starts onward to page 3.",gnprice,https://api.github.com/repos/flutter/flutter/git/commits/84f5b1cb09ea8c485fe11da686b5ceb7dfcf2660
