Set config.action_controller.asset_path_template to a proc that takes one
argument - the direct, unchanged asset path - and returns a path to that asset
using the scheme that your assets require.

This is useful if you have a setup which scales by introducing new application
servers where the mtime of the asset files may not be the same as those of the
asset files on your previous servers, but it does require your web servers to
have knowledge of the asset template paths that you rewrite to so it's not
suitable for out-of-the-box use. An example of configuring asset path
generation and rewriting these paths using Apache is included in
actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/asset_tag_helper.rb.

59982acd632dbfa2b41818b35f81ca65731b5519,"Always flush logger at exit

Prior to this change, running code via script/runner would demonstrate
different logging behavior than running the same code via a rake task.
In production mode the script/runner approach would always flush the
logger, but the rake-based approach would not automatically flush the
logger. This discrepancy violates the principle of least surprise, and
it could lead to the loss of important production logging data.

This change removes special-case code in the ""runner"" command, and
replaces it with a general solution to ensure that the logger gets
flushed at exit. This solution works for ""runner"", ""console"", ""server"",
rake tasks, and any other process that loads the Rails environment.",jasonrudolph,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/59982acd632dbfa2b41818b35f81ca65731b5519

Rails::Engine don't seem to understand that an engine could have

Currently if the code that calls .find_in_batches modifies the yielded array in place then .find_in_batches can enter an infinite loop searching with ruby object ids in the database instead of the primary key of records in the database. This happens because it naively assumes the yielded array hasn't been modified before calling #id on the last object in the array. And ruby (1.8 at least) alias' #id to #object_id so an integer is still returned no matter what the last object is.

Assuming the type "":touch"", Collector.new was calling
send(:touch), which instead of triggering method_missing
and generating a new collector method, actually
invoked the private method `touch` inherited from
Object.

By generating the method for each mime type as it
is registered, the private methods on Object can
never be reached by `send`, because the `Collector`
will have them before `send` is called on it.

To do this, a callback mechanism was added to Mime::Type

This allows someone to add a callback for whenever
a new mime type is registered. The callback then
gets called with the new mime as a parameter.

This is then used in AbstractController::Collector
to generate new collector methods after each mime
is registered.",mirceapricop,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/021f3d24f32dbad98c72cd5c36ff0b511be07a64

2f9a0f75db51993b9e18580697f140d5e36bed96,"Only use prepared statements when bind variables are present

Prepared statements (prepare/execute/close) were being used unnecessarily
when no bind variables were present, and disabling prepared statement using
prepared_statements:false was principally broken. While bind variables were
correctly substituted with prepared_statements:false, the prepared statement
interface was still used, costing an extra two round trips per query.

In addition to making this behavioral change, I also cleaned up the internals
of exec_stmt and exec_without_stmt so that they behave the same (calling log
and constructing the ActiveRecord::Result in the same way).

Moving the check for binds.empty? to exec_query also will mean that several
code paths explicitly calling exec_without_stmt could be cleaned up to once
again call exec_query instead. I have also left the check for binds.empty? in
exec_stmt, since it is not a private method and could be called directly with
an empty binds array. For the sake of clarity in this patch, I have not made
those changes.

= The previous behavior =

When issuing a Foo.find(1) with prepared_statements:true, the bind variable
is present in the prepared query, and execute shows a value passed:

    Connect	root@localhost on rails_test
    Query	SET SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0
    Statistics
    Query	SHOW FULL FIELDS FROM `foos`
    Query	SHOW TABLES LIKE 'foos'
    Query	SHOW CREATE TABLE `foos`
    Prepare	SELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = ? LIMIT 1
    Execute	SELECT  `foos`.* FROM `foos`  WHERE `foos`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
    Close stmt
    Quit

When issuing a Foo.find(1) with prepared_statements:false, the bind variable
has already been removed and substituted with the value, but the prepared
statement interface is used anyway:

    Connect	root@localhost on rails_test
    Query	SET SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0
    Statistics
    Query	SHOW FULL FIELDS FROM `foos`
    Query	SHOW TABLES LIKE 'foos'

I believe when people use generators, they typically order the
parameters on the command line in an order that makes sense
to them.  Sorting them in the generated code  makes the order

to computers. :-)

    rails g scaffold Post title:string content:text

PostgreSQLAdapter::create_database with options that have,

Currently, json/encoding respects the JSON spec (as it should) which 
disallows \n and \r inside strings, escaping them as expected.

Unfortunately, ECMA-262 (Javascript) disallows not only \n and \r in 
strings, but ""Line Terminators"" which includes U+2028 and U+2029. 
See here: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.3

This pull request adds U+2028 and U+2029 to be escaped.

# Why? 

It's very common to see something like this in a Rails template:

<script type=""text/javascript""> 
var posts = <%= @posts.to_json %>;
</script>

If U+2028 or U+2029 are part of any attributes output in the to_json
call, you will end up with an exception.
In Chrome: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL 

# Why not?

This is JSON encoding, and the JSON spec is specific about how to 
encode strings. U+2028 and U+2029 don't get special treatment.

This allows you to skip callbacks that are defined by objects, e.g. for
`ActionController`:

    skip_after_filter MySpecialFilter

Previously this didn't work due to a bug in how Rails compared callbacks
in `Callback#matches?`. When a callback is compiled, if it's an object
filter (i.e. not a method, proc, etc.), `Callback` now defines a method on
`@klass` that is derived from the class name rather than `@callback_id`.
So, when `skip_callback` tries to find the appropriate callback to
remove, `Callback` can regenerate the method name for the filter
object and return the correct value for `Callback#matches?`.",benmcredmond,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/e377228342e0185ef77ad8a58a8df4ece1683e80

- A new association record is being created.
- There is a unique index one of the association's fields.

Before, the deletion of records was postponed until after all

4e2bec383239f9ab3493208ef3bad1f2cbea3c93,"ActiveRecord::Relation#blank? should `LIMIT 1`

This is an SQL improvement to ActiveRecord::Relation#blank?. Currently,
it calls `to_a` on the Relation, which loads all records in the
association, and calls `blank?` on the loaded Array. There are other
ways, however, to check the emptiness of an association that are far
more performant. `#empty?`, `#exists?` and `#any?` all attach a `LIMIT
1` to the SQL query before firing it off, which is a nice query
improvement. `#blank?` should do the same!

Bonus performance improvements will also happen for `#present?`, which
merely calls the negation of `#blank?`

39b5bfe2394d0a4d479b41ee8d170e0f6c65fd59,"Specified column type for quote_value

When calling quote_value the underlying connection sometimes requires
more information about the column to properly return the correct quoted
value.

I ran into this issue when using optimistic locking in JRuby and the
activerecord-jdbcmssql-adapter. In SQLSever 2000, we aren't allowed to
insert a integer into a NVARCHAR column type so we need to format it as
N'3' if we want to insert into the NVARCHAR type. Unfortuantely, without
the column type being passed the connection adapter cannot properly return
the correct quote value because it doesn't know to return N'3' or '3'.

This patch is fairly straight forward where it just passes in the column
type into the quote_value, as it already has the ability to take in the column,
so it can properly handle at the connection level.

I've added the tests required to make sure that the quote_value method
is being passed the column type so that the underlying connection can
determine how to quote the value.",alfredw,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/39b5bfe2394d0a4d479b41ee8d170e0f6c65fd59

51d9b9a821a8f3f11fc5f52321df6ee05e4e1327,"[Fixes #11512] improves cache size calculation in ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore

Previously, the cache size of `ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore` was calculated
as the sum of the size of its entries, ignoring the size of keys and any data
structure overhead. This could lead to the calculated cache size sometimes being
10-100x smaller than the memory used, e.g., in the case of small values.

The size of a key/entry pair is now calculated via `#cached_size`:

    def cached_size(key, entry)
      key.to_s.bytesize + entry.size + PER_ENTRY_OVERHEAD
    end

The value of `PER_ENTRY_OVERHEAD` is 240 bytes based on an [empirical
estimation](https://gist.github.com/ssimeonov/6047200) for 64-bit MRI on
1.9.3 and 2.0.

8062a307942cb3f7a83bfc1a8cd81e3a1f8edc5b,"Better support for `where()` conditions that use an association name.

Using the name of an association in `where` previously worked only
if the value was a single `ActiveRecrd::Base` object. e.g.

    Post.where(author: Author.first)

Any other values, including `nil`, would cause invalid SQL to be
generated. This change supports arguments in the `where` query
conditions where the key is a `belongs_to` association name and the
value is `nil`, an `Array` of `ActiveRecord::Base` objects, or an
`ActiveRecord::Relation` object.

    # Given the Post model
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :author
    end

    # nil value finds records where the association is not set
    Post.where(author: nil)
    # SELECT ""posts"".* FROM ""posts"" WHERE ""posts"".""author_id"" IS NULL

    # Array values find records where the association foreign key
    # matches the ids of the passed ActiveRecord models, resulting
    # in the same query as Post.where(author_id: [1,2])
    authors_array = [Author.find(1), Author.find(2)]
    Post.where(author: authors_array)

    # ActiveRecord::Relation values find records using the same
    # query as Post.where(author_id: Author.where(last_name: ""Emde""))
    Post.where(author: Author.where(last_name: ""Emde""))

Polymorphic `belongs_to` associations will continue to be handled
appropriately, with the polymorphic `association_type` field added
to the query to match the base class of the value. This feature
previously only worked when the value was a single `ActveRecord::Base`.

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :author, polymorphic: true
    end

    Post.where(author: Author.where(last_name: ""Emde""))

a351149e805910cd980bee1558e56e61c4a82db2,"Fix controller test not resetting @_url_options

Commit 4f2cd3e9 introduced a bug by reordering the call to
`@controller.recycle!` above the call to `build_request_uri`. The
impact of this was that the `@_url_options` cache ends up not being
reset between building a request URI (occurring within the test
controller) and the firing of the actual request.

We encountered this bug because we had the following setup:

  class MinimumReproducibleController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter { @param = 'param' }

    def index
      render text: url_for(params)
    end

    def default_url_options
      { custom_opt: @param }
    end
  end

  def test_index
    get :index # builds url, then fires actual request
  end

The first step in  `get :index` in the test suite would populate the
@_url_options cache. The subsequent call to `url_for` inside of the
controller action would then utilize the uncleared cache, thus never
calling the now-updated default_url_options.

This commit fixes this bug calling recycle! twice, and removes a call
to set response_body, which should no longer be needed since we're
recycling the request object explicitly.",twooster,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/a351149e805910cd980bee1558e56e61c4a82db2

e972d341209f64d1599e30a36b82eee2aa4cd553,"Generate shallow paths for all children of shallow resources.

Prior to this commit shallow resources would only generate paths for
non-direct children (with a nested depth greater than 1).

Take the following routes file.

    resources :blogs do
      resources :posts, shallow: true do
        resources :comments do
          resources :tags
        end
      end
    end

This would generate shallow paths for `tags` nested under `posts`,
e.g `/posts/:id/tags/`, however it would not generate shallow paths
for `comments` nested under `posts`, e.g `/posts/:id/comments/new`.

This commit changes the behaviour of the route mapper so that it
generate paths for direct children of shallow resources, for example
if you take the previous routes file, this will now generate
shallow paths for `comments` nested under `posts`, .e.g
`posts/:id/comments/new`.

This was the behaviour in Rails `4.0.4` however this was broken in
@jcoglan's fix for another routes related issue[1].

This also fixes an issue[2] reported by @smdern.

2859341c383daac74608f978d8e8fad2229042a3,"Fixing numeric attrs when set to same negative value

This bug occurs when an attribute of an ActiveRecord model is an
ActiveRecord::Type::Integer type or a ActiveRecord::Type::Decimal type (or any
other type that includes the ActiveRecord::Type::Numeric module. When the value
of the attribute is negative and is set to the same negative value, it is marked
as changed.

Take the following example of a Person model with the integer attribute age:

    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      # age          :integer(4)
    end

The following will produce the error:

    person = Person.new(age: -1)
    person.age = -1
    person.changes
    => { ""age"" => [-1, -1] }
    person.age_changed?
    => true

The problematic line is here:

    module ActiveRecord
      module Type
        module Numeric
          ...

          def non_numeric_string?(value)

When trying to checkout connection from connection pool,
checkout()(and checkout_and_verify) verify whether the connection
is active or not.
And, if the connection is not active, connection adapters try to
reconnect to server.  And, if database is down at this moment,
reconnect fails and exception is raised.
(Ex: Mysql2::Error: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket xxx)

But, ConnectionPool does not catch the exception, but leaks current
disconnected connection to @connection.
So, if database's temporary down happens several times and exceeds
the number of connection pool(5 by default), activerecord will be
no more available, even if database server is already recovered.

096586356426d72c300c8fa854d66703d5481378,"Closes rails/rails#18864: Renaming transactional fixtures to transactional tests

I’m renaming all instances of `use_transcational_fixtures` to
`use_transactional_tests` and “transactional fixtures” to
“transactional tests”.

I’m deprecating `use_transactional_fixtures=`. So anyone who is
explicitly setting this will get a warning telling them to use
`use_transactional_tests=` instead.

I’m maintaining backwards compatibility—both forms will work.
`use_transactional_tests` will check to see if
`use_transactional_fixtures` is set and use that, otherwise it will use
itself. But because `use_transactional_tests` is a class attribute
(created with `class_attribute`) this requires a little bit of hoop
jumping. The writer method that `class_attribute` generates defines a
new reader method that return the value being set. Which means we can’t
set the default of `true` using `use_transactional_tests=` as was done
previously because that won’t take into account anyone using
`use_transactional_fixtures`. Instead I defined the reader method
manually and it checks `use_transactional_fixtures`. If it was set then
it should be used, otherwise it should return the default, which is
`true`. If someone uses `use_transactional_tests=` then it will

The `db:schema:cache:dump` rake task dumps the database schema structure
to `db/schema_cache.dump`. If this file is present, the schema details
are loaded into the currently checked out connection by a railtie while
Rails is booting, to avoid having to query the database for its schema.

The schema cache dump is only applied to the initial connection used to
boot the application though; other connections from the same pool are
created with an empty schema cache, and still have to load the structure
of each table directly from the database.

f5d8dd6d8fc13bf931896f8435baf9779b3136ab,"More granular console SQL coloration

This new coloration approach makes it easier to scan the rails console
for specific types of activity with more fine-grained visual cues.

Virtual terminal ANSI color escape codes are used when displaying SQL
statements in the rails console. The former implementation alternates
line prefix information (including the statement name and execution
latency) between CYAN and MAGENTA. This visually differentiates any SQL
statements in the log and is useful for quickly scanning for database
activity.

While a great idea and a solid foundation, alternating between just two
colors on an even/odd basis (much like striping an HTML table) can be
improved upon.

This patch replaces the even/odd striping with a more comprehensive
scheme that applies coloration based on the type of statement being
run. Every statement logged has its prefix (name and latency) colored
white (as the statement body was previously). The statement body is now
colored according to the nature of the statement:

  - INSERT statements are GREEN (symbolic of creation or genesis)
  - SELECT statements are BLUE (typically used for informational
    displays, as SELECT statements do not normally have side-effects)
  - DELETE statements are RED (commonly used to indicate the danger of
    a destructive action)
  - UPDATE statements are YELLOW (it's like a less extreme RED :P)
  - TRANSACTION statements are CYAN (arbitrary)
  - and any other statements are MAGENTA (again, arbitrary)",cmtonkinson,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/f5d8dd6d8fc13bf931896f8435baf9779b3136ab

There's a typo in ActiveRecord associations RDocs.
Wrong `Taggable` model name, instead of `Tagging` in example of using
option `:inverse_of` with `:belongs_to` association.

Commit where typo was introduced:
https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/91fd6510563f84ee473bb217bc63ed598abe3f24#diff-39001423802a8470dba9c931e66e101eR11

First it appears in `activerecord/CHANGELOG` in example of `:inverse_of`
usage:

```ruby
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :taggings
      has_many :tags, :through => :taggings
    end

    class Tagging < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :post
      belongs_to :tag, :inverse_of => :tagging # :inverse_of must be set!
    end

    class Tag < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :taggings
      has_many :posts, :through => :taggings
    end

    post = Post.first
    tag = post.tags.build :name => ""ruby""
!>  tag.save # will save a Taggable linking to the post
```

The last line should be

```ruby
    tag.save # will save a Tagging linking to the post
```

The same typo appears in
`activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb`.
The association name is given as `:inverse_of => :taggings`, but class
name is `Taggable`.

```ruby
    #   @post = Post.first
    #   @tag = @post.tags.build :name => ""ruby""
    #   @tag.save
    #
!>  # The last line ought to save the through record (a <tt>Taggable</tt>). This will only work if the
    # <tt>:inverse_of</tt> is set:
    #
!>  #   class Taggable < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :post
!>  #     belongs_to :tag, :inverse_of => :taggings

When generating the url for a mounted engine through its proxy, the path should be the sum of three parts:

1. Any `SCRIPT_NAME` request header or the value of `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#relative_url_root`.
2. A prefix (the engine's mounted path).
3. The path of the named route inside the engine.

Since commit https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/44ff0313c121f528a68b3bd21d6c7a96f313e3d3, this has been broken. Step 2 has been changed to:

2. A prefix (the value of `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#relative_url_root` + the engine's mounted path).

The value of `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#relative_url_root` is taken into account in step 1 of the route generation and should be ignored when generating the mounted engine's prefix in step 2.

This commit fixes the regression by having `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#url_for` check `options[:relative_url_root]` before falling back to `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#relative_url_root`. The prefix generating code then sets `options[:relative_url_root]` to an empty string. This empty string is used instead of `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#relative_url_root` and avoids the duplicate `relative_url_root` value in the final result.

4db921a8e7dff22eec026e809c39567db6a9ee32,"Allow multiple `root` routes in same scope level

When an application has multiple root entries with different
constraints, the current solution is to use `get '/'`. Example:

**Currently I have to do:**
```ruby
get '/', to: 'portfolio#show', constraints: ->(req) { Hostname.portfolio_site?(req.host) }
get '/', to: 'blog#show',      constraints: ->(req) { Hostname.blog_site?(req.host) }
root 'landing#show'
```

**But I would like to do:**
```ruby
root 'portfolio#show', constraints: ->(req) { Hostname.portfolio_site?(req.host) }
root 'blog#show',      constraints: ->(req) { Hostname.blog_site?(req.host) }
root 'landing#show'
```

Other URL matchers such as `get`, `post`, etc, already allows this, so I
think it's fair that `root` also allow it since it's just a shortcut for
a `get` internally.",rafaelsales,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/4db921a8e7dff22eec026e809c39567db6a9ee32

The default timestamp used for AR is `updated_at` in nanoseconds! (:nsec) This causes issues on any machine that runs an OS that supports nanoseconds timestamps, i.e. not-OS X, where the cache_key of the record persisted in the database (milliseconds precision) is out-of-sync with the cache_key in the ruby VM.

This commit adds:

A test that shows the issue, it can be found in the separate file `cache_key_test.rb`, because
- model couldn't be defined inline
- transactional testing needed to be turned off to get it to pass the MySQL tests
This seemed cleaner than putting it in an existing testcase file.

Use an example from a default Rails app (4.2.5) rather than an outdated one in the Configuring Rails Components section.
I picked config.time_zone as it currently is the only 'setting for Rails' left in a default config/application.rb.

I stumbled upon this with investigating autoloading in a legacy app, which still included the example comment ""# config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/extras)"". Usually adding app/* directories to autoload_paths isn't necessary, so also finding this example within the current docs was a bit confusing initially.

d1dcdf21286cb459a422b6b88967d712c75f002a,"Fix rake db:structure:dump on Postgres when multiple schemas are used.

If postgresql is being used and there are multiple schemas listed on the
`schema_search_path`, then `structure.sql` dumps (triggered by `rake
db:structure:dump` or `config.active_record.schema_format = :sql`) began
failing in Rails 4.2.5.

This is due to the changes made in
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17885 The problem is that multiple
schemas were getting getting passed to `Kernel.system` as a single,
space delimited string argument (for example, ""--schema=foo
--schema=bar""). However, with the updated array style of calling
`Kernel.system`, these need to be passed as separate arguments (for
example, ""--schema=foo"", ""--schema=bar""). If they get passed as a single
string, then the underlying pg_dump program isn't sure how to interpret
that single argument and you'll get an error reporting: ""pg_dump: No
matching schemas were found""",GUI,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/d1dcdf21286cb459a422b6b88967d712c75f002a

fail as the ctime of the files written by these TestJobs could have coincidental ctimes

221b4aead579ebae28477e889a7ee68a6668b0fa,"Avoid multiple default paths to server.pid file

Fix bug (#22811) that occurs when rails server is started in daemon mode
and optional path to the `server.pid` file is omitted. Store default path
in a constant instead of evaluating it multiple time using `File.expand_path`.

The bug in detail: The server startup procedure crashes, since it tries to
open a file at `/tmp/pids/server.pid` instead of
`<path to project>/tmp/pids/server.pid`. This bug was introduced in 51211a94bd
when Rack was upgraded from version 1.x to 2.x. Since version 2.x,
Rack does not memoize the options hash [1], and as a consequence
`Rails::Server#default_options` will be evaluated multiple times.
The hash returned by `Rails::Server#default_options` holds the default path
to the `server.pid` file. The path is generated with the method
`File.expand_path`. However, the return value of this method depends on the
current working directory [2], which changes once `Process.daemon` is invoked
by `Rack::Server#daemonize_app` and the process is detached from the current
shell.

    add_index :person_articles, :article, unique: true

a join table (based on the prior example) so should use :article_id

The documentation seems to suggest that it will allow an article to
be added only once to a person via the join table, what actually
occurs is that it only allows the article to be added to one person,
at which point it should be a `belongs_to` association.

138c1db83e13cc01c54ac9657c8388aa46324582,"Added references option to join tables

Fixes issue #22960
When creating join tables with the command

    rails g migration CreateJoinTableShowroomUser showroom:references user:references

The migration will use references to create the joins and output:

     class CreateJoinTableShowroomUser < ActiveRecord::Migration
       def change
         create_join_table :showrooms, :users do |t|
           t.references :showroom, index: true, foreign_key: true
           t.references :user, index: true, foreign_key: true
         end
       end
     end

This allows for proper refrences with indexes and foreign keys to be easily used when
adding join tables. Without `:refrences` the normal output is generated:

    class CreateJoinTableShowroomUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
      def change
        create_join_table :showrooms, :users do |t|
          # t.index [:showroom_id, :user_id]
          # t.index [:user_id, :showroom_id]

From: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/24279

Problem:
By doing `record.errors.include? :foo`, it adds a new key to the
@messages hash that defaults to an empty array.

This happens because of a combination of these 2 commits:
https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b97035df64f5b2f912425c4a7fcb6e6bb3ddab8d
(Added in Rails 4.1)

(Rails 5.0)

By adding the default proc that returns an array for non-existing keys,
ruby adds that key to the hash.

Solution:
Change `#include?` to check with `has_key?` and then check if that value is
`present?`.

This can be an issue when TZInfo::TimeZone#current_period is refreshed
due to timezone period transition, but it's not reflected in
ActiveSupport::TimeZone object.

For example, on Sun, 26 Oct 2014 22:00 UTC, Moscow changed its TZ from
MSK +04:00 to MSK +03:00 (-1 hour). If ActiveSupport::TimeZone['Moscow']
happens to be initialized just before the timezone transition, it will
cache its stale utc_offset even after the timezone transition.

3b49d792231f8051a82cee37c46ac5b23de844db,"fix to_param to maximize content

The documentation states that parameter values longer than 20 characters
will be truncated by words, but the example shows that a parameter based
on ""David Heinemeier Hansson"" (with id: 125) becomes ""125-david"" when
""David Heinemeier"".length == 16 so why so short?

The answer lies in the use of the #truncate option omission: nil which
seems to have been intended to mean ""nothing"", but which actually causes
the default string ""..."" to be used. This causes #truncate to cleave
words until the ""..."" can be added and still remain within the requested
size of 20 characters.

The better option is omission: '' (which is probably what was originally
intended).

Furthermore, since the use of #parameterize will remove non-alphanumeric
characters, we can maximize the useful content of the output by calling
parameterize first and then giving truncate a separator: /-/ rather than

In integration test when specify the ""Accept"" header with ""xhr: true""
option, the Accept header is overridden with a default xhr Accept
header. The issue only affects HTTP header ""Accept"" but not CGI variable
""HTTP_ACCEPT"".

For example:

    get '/page', headers: { 'Accept' => 'application/json' }, xhr: true

    # This is WRONG! And the response.content_type is also affected.
    # It should be ""application/json""
    assert_equal ""text/javascript, text/html, ..."", request.accept
    assert_equal 'text/html', response.content_type

The issue is in `ActionDispatch::Integration::RequestHelpers`. When
setting ""xhr: true"" the helper sets a default HTTP_ACCEPT if blank.
But the code doesn't consider supporting both HTTP header style and
CGI variable style.

The current behaviour of checking if there is a LEFT OUTER JOIN arel
node to detect if we are doing eager_loading is wrong. This problem
wasn't frequent before as only some pretty specific cases would add
a LEFT OUTER JOIN arel node. However, the recent new feature
left_outer_joins also add this node and made this problem happen
frequently.

Since in the perform_calculation function, we don't have access to
eager_loading information, I had to extract the logic for the distinct
out to the calculate method.

As I was in the file for left_outer_join tests, I fixed a few that had
bugs and I replaced some that were really weak with something that
will catch more issues.

In relation tests, the first test I changed would have failed if it
had validated the hash returned by count instead of just checking how
many pairs were in it. This is because this merge of join currently
transforms the join node into an outer join node, which then made
count do a distinct. So before this change, the return was

When `config.force_ssl` is set to `true`, any POST/PUT/DELETE requests coming in to non-secure url are being redirected with a 301 status.
However, when that happens, the request is converted to a GET request and ends up hitting a different action on the controller.

Since we can not do non-GET redirects, we can instead redirect with a 307 status code instead to indicate to the caller that a fresh request should be tried preserving the original request method.

cdf8a2b49307953fbcd93df9fdec3c23063740b1,"Cache results of computing model type

We faced a significant performance decrease when we started using STI
without storing full namespaced class name in type column (because of PostgreSQL
length limit for ENUM types).
We realized that the cause of it is the slow STI model instantiation. Problematic
method appears to be `ActiveRecord::Base.compute_type`, which is used to find
the right class for STI model on every instantiation.
It builds an array of candidate types and then iterates through it calling
`safe_constantize` on every type until it finds appropriate constant. So if
desired type isn't the first element in this array there will be at least one
unsuccessful call to `safe_constantize`, which is very expensive, since it's
defined in terms of `begin; rescue; end`.

This commit is an attempt to speed up `compute_type` method simply by caching
results of previous calls.

9ca712348e547815d04a6e1e13b9faf71ebce987,"Prevent event propogation if element is disabled when event chain begins.

The existing UJS event behavior relies on browsers not sending events for
various events when an element is disabled. For example, imagine the following:

    <button type=""submit"" disabled=""disabled"">Click me</button>

The above button is disabled, so browsers will not trigger a click event and
all UJS behavior is prevented. However, imagine a button like this:

    <button type=""submit"" disabled=""disabled""><strong>Click me</strong></button>

The above is treated differently by browsers such as Chrome/Safari. These
browsers do not consider the strong tag to be disabled, and will trigger click
events. UJS has logic to walk up the DOM to find an associated element subject
to UJS behavior. But, this logic does not take into account the disabled
status of the element.

I originally thought we could simply change the selectors used to match
elements to ignore disabled elements. However, UJS disables some elements as
part of the event chain. So, an element might match early in the chain and
then fail to match later. Instead of changing the selectors I added a callback
to the chain that calls `stopEverything` if an element is disabled when the
event chain begins.",ptoomey3,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/9ca712348e547815d04a6e1e13b9faf71ebce987

452f9ee0bcca071cb520d3d640acebdc91f5e3ef,"Add error logging to Active Job

Active Job logging instrumentation is changed to log errors (with
backtrace) when a job raises an exception in #perform. This improves
debugging during development and test with the default configuration.

Prior to Rails 5, the default development configuration ran jobs with
InlineAdapter, which would raise exceptions to the caller and be
shown in the development log. In Rails 5, the default adapter was
changed to AsyncAdapter, which would silently swallow exceptions
and log a ""Performed SomeJob from Async..."" info message. This could
be confusing to a developer, as it would seem that the job was
performed successfully.

This patch removes the ""Performed..."" info message from the log
and adds an error-level ""Error performing SomeJob..."" log message
which includes the exception backtrace for jobs that raise an
exception within the #perform method. It provides this behavior for
all adapters.",sbull,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/452f9ee0bcca071cb520d3d640acebdc91f5e3ef

1b4360dea81b0c04589a62b8af7c555cfc0509ca,"Enable query cache if set a configurations

ActiveRecord query cache is available when a connection is connected.
Therefore, query cache is unavailable when entering the ActiveRecord::Base.cache block without being connected.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.cache do
  Task.find(1) # access to database.
  Task.find(1) # access to database. unavailable query cache
end
```

If we use query cache with batch script etc, we need to connect before that.
```ruby
Task.connection

ActiveRecord::Base.cache do
  Task.find(1) # access to database.
  Task.find(1) # available query cache
end
```

Before version 3.1, query cache had been enabled if a configuration was set up.
In order to solve the `DATABASE_URL` issue(#8074), ActiveRecord has checked whether a connection is connected or not.

Today, ActiveRecord.configurations respect `DATABASE_URL`.

`Array#delete` searches for all occurrences in the `target` array. When performing `dependent: :destroy` in active_record/associations/collection_association, the loop becomes O(N^2). It is particularly slow when destroying large amount of associations (e.g. 10K records).

Either `Hash` or `Set` can optimize the loop to O(N). `Hash` is slightly faster in this simple usage.

This regression was caused due to a wrong regex to filter out

line number specification, existence of a directory at that path

51b6c3429f41ebbc571b8fcbe7c21d3131b832d8,"`Postgres::OID::Range` serializes to a `Range`, quote in `Quoting`

PostgreSQL 9.1+ introduced range types, and Rails added support for
using this datatype in ActiveRecord. However, the serialization of
`PostgreSQL::OID::Range` was incomplete, because it did not properly
quote the bounds that make up the range. A clear example of this is a
`tsrange`.

Normally, ActiveRecord quotes Date/Time objects to include the
milliseconds. However, the way `PostgreSQL::OID::Range` serialized its
bounds, the milliseconds were dropped. This meant that the value was
incomplete and not equal to the submitted value.

An example of normal timestamps vs. a `tsrange`. Note how the bounds
for the range do not include their milliseconds (they were present in
the ruby Range):

    UPDATE ""iterations"" SET ""updated_at"" = $1, ""range"" = $2 WHERE
    ""iterations"".""id"" = $3
    [[""updated_at"", ""2017-09-23 17:07:01.304864""],
    [""range"", ""[2017-09-23 00:00:00 UTC,2017-09-23 23:59:59 UTC]""],
    [""id"", 1234]]

`PostgreSQL::OID::Range` serialized the range by interpolating a
string for the range, which works for most cases, but does not work
for timestamps:

    def serialize(value)
      if value.is_a?(::Range)
        from = type_cast_single_for_database(value.begin)
        to = type_cast_single_for_database(value.end)
        ""[#{from},#{to}#{value.exclude_end? ? ')' : ']'}""
      else
        super
      end
    end

    (byebug) from = type_cast_single_for_database(value.begin)
    2010-01-01 13:30:00 UTC

    (byebug) to = type_cast_single_for_database(value.end)
    2011-02-02 19:30:00 UTC

    (byebug) ""[#{from},#{to}#{value.exclude_end? ? ')' : ']'}""
    ""[2010-01-01 13:30:00 UTC,2011-02-02 19:30:00 UTC)""

@sgrif (the original implementer for Postgres Range support) provided
some feedback about where the quoting should occur:

  Yeah, quoting at all is definitely wrong here. I'm not sure what I
  was thinking in 02579b5, but what this is doing is definitely in the
  wrong place. It should probably just be returning a range of
  subtype.serialize(value.begin) and subtype.serialize(value.end), and
  letting the adapter handle the rest.

`Postgres::OID::Range` now returns a `Range` object, and
`ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQL::Quoting` can now encode
and quote a `Range`:

    def encode_range(range)
      ""[#{type_cast(range.first)},#{type_cast(range.last)}#{range.exclude_end? ? ')' : ']'}""
    end

    ...

    encode_range(range)
    #=> ""['2010-01-01 13:30:00.670277','2011-02-02 19:30:00.745125')""

1fe7168df0a23b69539b60327943495a3dded9e5,"Resolve Minitest 6 deprecation in assert_no_changes

These changes resolve a deprecation warning in `assert_no_changes`
when asserting that an expression evaluates to `nil` before and after
the passed block is evaluated.

The smallest demonstration of this edge case:

```ruby
assert_no_changes ""nil"" do
  true # noop
end
```

Under the covers, this is evaluating

```ruby
assert_equal nil, nil
```

Minitest 5 issues a deprecation warning, and Minitest will fail
completely.

For additional context, the motivations and implications of this change
to Minitest have been discussed at length in [seattlerb/minitest#666][].

af0361da0ac7e5b7703e772ce69c21c3315a54d0,"`assert_changes` should always assert some change

While using `assert_changes`, I came across some unexpected behavior:
if you provide a `to:` argument, and the expression matches but didn't
actually change, the assertion will pass.

The way `assert_changes` reads, I assumed that it would both assert
that there was any change at all, _and_ that the expression changed to
match my `to:` argument.

In the case of just a `from:` argument, `assert_changes` does what I
expect as well. It asserts that the before value `=== from` and that
the after value changed.

My key change is that `assert_changes` will now _always_ assert that

Previously, if a record was created with a custom primary key, that
table could not be migrated using sqlite. While attempting to copy the
table, the type of the primary key was ignored.

Once that was corrected, copying the indexes would fail because custom
primary keys are autoindexed by sqlite by default.

To correct that, this skips copying the index if the index name begins
with ""sqlite_"". This is a reserved word that indicates that the
index is an internal schema object. SQLite prohibits applications from
creating objects whose names begin with ""sqlite_"", so this string should
be safe to use as a check.

9adaf605b4fb0075855c062c30fa4fdd96927b93,"Preserve original method visibility when deprecating a method

This commit fixes `deprecate` so that it preserves method visibility (like it
did previously when it was utilizing `alias_method_chain`).

When Module#prepend replaced alias_method_chain in a982a42 it caused deprecated
methods to always become public.

`alias_method_chain` had this bit of code:
https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.0.6/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/module/aliasing.rb#L40-L47
which preserved method visibility.

Without this fix, a workaround would be:

```ruby
class C8
  private

  def new_method
  end

  def old_method
  end
  deprecate :old_method, :new_method
  # workaround:
  instance_method(:old_method).owner.send(:private, :old_method)

This allows activestorage users to ship smaller javascript bundles to
visitors using modern browsers, as demonstrated in this repository:
https://github.com/rmacklin/activestorage-es2015-build-example

In that example, the bundle shrinks by 5K (24%).

In addition to allowing smaller bundles for those who ship untranspiled
code to modern browsers, including the source code in the published
package can be useful in other ways:

1. Users can import individual modules rather than the whole library
2. As a result of (1), users can also monkey patch parts of
   activestorage by importing the relevant module, modifying the
   exported object, and then importing the rest of activestorage (which
   would then use the patched object).

Note:
In order to allow the source code to be depended on rather than the
compiled code, we have to declare the external dependency on spark-md5
as a regular dependency, not a development dependency.

This means that even users who depend on the compiled code will have to
download this package. However, spark-md5 is a small package, so this

d3fd4e4ed9bae3775969c5c913b15bbd927e9ad9,"Expose foreign key name ignore pattern in configuration

When dumping the database schema, Rails will dump foreign key names only
if those names were not generate by Rails. Currently this is determined
by checking if the foreign key name is `fk_rails_` followed by
a 10-character hash.

At [Cookpad](https://github.com/cookpad), we use
[Departure](https://github.com/departurerb/departure) (Percona's
pt-online-schema-change runner for ActiveRecord migrations) to run migrations.
Often, `pt-osc` will make a copy of a table in order to run a long migration
without blocking it. In this copy process, foreign keys are copied too,
but [their name is prefixed with an underscore to prevent name collision
](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html#cmdoption-pt-online-schema-change-alter-foreign-keys-method).

In the process described above, we often end up with a development
database that contains foreign keys which name starts with `_fk_rails_`.
That name does not match the ignore pattern, so next time Rails dumps
the database schema (eg. when running `rake db:migrate`), our
`db/schema.rb` file ends up containing those unwanted foreign key names.
This also produces an unwanted git diff that we'd prefer not to commit.

In this PR, I'd like to suggest a way to expose the foreign key name
ignore pattern to the Rails configuration, so that individual projects
can decide on a different pattern of foreign keys that will not get
their names dumped in `schema.rb`.",davidstosik,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/d3fd4e4ed9bae3775969c5c913b15bbd927e9ad9

eede8d8130558cb46aba8736bd63e8a28e37eac2,"Add `action_view.finalize_compiled_template_methods` config option

ActionView::Template instances compile their source to methods on the
ActionView::CompiledTemplates module. To prevent leaks in development
mode, where templates can frequently change, a finalizer is added that
undefines these methods[1] when the templates are garbage-collected.

This is undesirable in the test environment, however, as templates don't
change during the life of the test. Moreover, the cost of undefining a
method is proportional to the number of descendants a class or module
has, since the method cache must be cleared for all descendant classes.

As ActionView::CompiledTemplates is mixed into every
ActionView::TestCase (or in RSpec suites, every view spec example
group), it can end up with a very large number of descendants, and
undefining its methods can become very expensive.

In large test suites, this results in a long delay at the end of the
test suite as all template finalizers are run, only for the process to
then exit.

To avoid this unnecessary cost, this change adds a config option,
`action_view.finalize_compiled_template_methods`, defaulting to true,
and sets it to false in the test environment only.

This tiniest of patch inserts `#to_s` before the `sub` call to make sure it succeeds. Affected surface area should be just as tiny since something has already gone wrong to get us into `#is_missing?` and the current behavior when `#path` returns `nil` seems clearly not intended.

### Steps to reproduce

Using Rails 5.2.0

When following this example:

http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveStorage/Variant.html

`avatar.variant(resize: ""100x100"", monochrome: true, flip: ""-90"")`

### Expected behavior

Image should be rendered as flipped.

### Actual behavior

I get an error:

> failed with error: gm mogrify: Unrecognized option (-90).

### Fix:

According to: https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick the option should be called rotate:

`avatar.variant(resize: ""100x100"", monochrome: true, rotate: ""-90"")`

So **flip** changed to **rotate**.

0210ac0b430757f2b5ba5e81f4391e6a37b769a4,"Disable variant options when false or nil present

In response to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/32917

In the current implementation, ActiveStorage passes all options to the underlying processor,
including when a key has a value of false.

For example, passing:

```
avatar.variant(resize: ""100x100"", monochrome: false, flip: ""-90"")
```

will return a monochrome image (or an error, pending on ImageMagick configuration) because
it passes `-monochrome false` to the command (but the command line does not allow disabling
flags this way, as usually a user would omit the flag entirely to disable that feature).

This fix only passes those keys forward to the underlying processor if the value responds to
`present?`. In practice, this means that `false` or `nil` will be filtered out before going
to the processor.

One possible use case would be for a user to be able to apply different filters to an avatar.
The code might look something like:

```
  variant_options = {
    monochrome: params[:monochrome],
    resize:     params[:resize]
  }

  avatar.variant(*variant_options)
```

Obviously some sanitization may be beneficial in a real-world scenario, but this type of
configuration object could be used in many other places as well.

- The entirety of #image_processing_transformation inject block was wrapped in `list.tap`

Before Rails' logger output is mirrored to std out if:

* environment is development and
* the process is not daemonized

It was not possible to change that behaviour, e.g. to disable log output
in that case or enable it in other cases.

Now you can explicitly disable or enable output with the new command
line switch `--log-to-stdout`, regardless of any other circumstances.

```
// enable output in production
rails server -e production --log-to-stdout

// disable output in development
rails server -e development --no-log-to-stdout
```

Enabling output when daemonized still makes no sense (since tty is
detached), but this is ignored for now.

applies, so this change is completely backward compatible.",doits,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/889a7ccf086c23baccb52342a631f1be81405e6b

20543c049625784a91944efdebc1d0c397406f21,"Add implicit to path conversion to uploaded file (#28676)

* Add implicit to path conversion to uploaded file

Ruby has a few implicit conversion protocols (e.g. `to_hash`, `to_str`,
`to_path`, etc.). These are considered implicit conversion protocols
because in certain instances Ruby (MRI core objects) will check if an
argument responds to the appropriate protocol and automatically convert
it when it does; this is why you can provide a `Pathname` instance into
`File.read` without having to explicitly call `to_s`.

```ruby
a_file_path = 'some/path/file.ext'
File.write a_file_path, 'String Path Content'
File.read a_file_path

a_pathname = Pathname(a_file_path)
File.write core_file, 'Pathname Content'
File.read a_file_path

core_file = File.new(a_pathname)
File.write core_file, 'File Content'
File.read core_file

tmp_file = Tempfile.new('example')
File.write tmp_file, 'Tempfile Content'
File.read tmp_file
```

So how does an uploaded file work in such cases?

```ruby
tmp_file = Tempfile.new('example')
File.write tmp_file, 'Uploaded Content'
uploaded_file = ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile.new(tempfile: tmp_file)
File.read uploaded_file
```

It fails with a `TypeError`:

    no implicit conversion of ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile into String

In order to make an uploaded file work it must be explicitly converted
to a file path using `path`.

```ruby
File.read uploaded_file.path
```

This requires any code that expects path/file like objects to either
special case an uploaded file, re-implement the path conversion protocol
to use `path`, or forces the developer to explicitly cast uploaded files
to paths. This last option can sometimes be difficult to do when such
calls are deep within the inner workings of libraries.

Since an uploaded file already has a path it makes sense to implement
the implicit ""path"" conversion protocol (just like `File` and
`Tempfile`). This change allows uploaded file content to be treated more
closely to regular file content, without requiring any special case
handling or explicit conversion for common file utilities.

Use a variable local to the `save_collection_association` method in
`activerecord/lib/active_record/autosave_association.rb`, instead of an
instance variable.

Prior to this PR, when there was a circular series of `autosave: true`
associations, the callback for a `has_many` association was run while
another instance of the same callback on the same association hadn't
finished running. When control returned to the first instance of the
callback, the instance variable had changed, and subsequent associated
records weren't saved correctly. Specifically, the ID field for the
`belongs_to` corresponding to the `has_many` was `nil`.

Some sensitive data will be exposed in log accidentally by calling `#inspect`, e.g.

```ruby

payload = { account: @account }
logger.info ""payload will be #{ payload }""
```

All the information of `@account` will be exposed in log.

* Solution
Add a class attribute filter_attributes to specify which values of columns shouldn't be exposed.
This attribute equals to `Rails.application.config.filter_parameters` by default.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.filter_parameters += [:credit_card_number]

We may not always have binstubs relative to the directory we are running
the rake task from. The particular case for this is with a mountable
Rails engine and dummy app that is created to test it. This sets all the
tasks up to run under an `app` namespace in
railties/lib/rails/tasks/engine.rake

This change resolves a problem whereby running `app:yarn:install` would
have no effect as it would try to run in the plugins bin directory
rather than the test/dummy/bin. This also means that it installs from
test/dummy/package.json and into test/dummy/node_modules which is
behaviour consistent with a normal Rails app.

This commit changes the contributing guide in rails to suggest using git
with force-with-lease over typical force pushing. In practice, most
rails contributors won't ever encounter a situation where updating their
local fork could result in lost changes as a result of a force push.

That being said, git is a complex tool and arcane flags like
force-with-lease are indeed safer, and by promoting it in rails, there's
a chance more people will discover it and use it in other contexts
outside of rails. In just the same way that herd immunity works by most
people being vaccinated, proliferating knowledge of force-with-lease
should help nudge people towards using safer git commands in general.

8104589c0824c648a769be50e04fc8e7dbb26ba0,"Fix handling of duplicates for `replace` on has_many-through

There was a bug in the handling of duplicates when
assigning (replacing) associated records, which made the result
dependent on whether a given record was associated already before
being assigned anew. E.g.

    post.people = [person, person]
    post.people.count
    # => 2

while

    post.people = [person]
    post.people = [person, person]
    post.people.count
    # => 1

This change adds a test to provoke the former incorrect behavior, and
fixes it.

Cause of the bug was the handling of record collections as sets, and
using `-` (difference) and `&` (union) operations on them
indiscriminately. This temporary conversion to sets would eliminate
duplicates.

The fix is to decorate record collections for these operations, and
only for the `has_many :through` case. It is done by counting
occurrences, and use the record together with the occurrence number as
element, in order to make them work well in sets. Given

    a, b = *Person.all

then the collection used for finding the difference or union of
records would be internally changed from

     [a, b, a]

to

     [[a, 1], [b, 1], [a, 2]]

for these operations. So a first occurrence and a second occurrence
would be distinguishable, which is all that is necessary for this
task.

d79366b4c9619e70a2c292b3a7c0311618eba9be,"Preserve Bundle configuration during app generation (#34755)

When generating a new rails application (rails new) using a custom template that
includes gems from an authenticated source, the user has to provide credentials to
bundler.

One way to do this is by exporting environment variables, for example:

export BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=user:pass: provides credentials for bundler to fetch
gems from github.com.

The problem this PR addresses is that we are currently scrubs all /BUNDLE_.*/
environment variables by wrapping our system calls in Bundler.with_clean_env.

We do this because we don't want our commands executed against the generated project
to use the generator's bundler environment (e.g. our gems): the generated project should
use it's own configuration.

The problem with Bundler.with_clean_env is that, on top of restoring environment
variables to their original state, it also scrubs any /BUNDLE_.*/ variables, which is harmful for authenticated gem sources.

This PR replaces Bundler.with_clean_env with Bundler.with_original_env, which only
restores environment variables to their initial state, without additional scrubbing.",marcotc,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/d79366b4c9619e70a2c292b3a7c0311618eba9be

6735a0719d43b08a18bb5ea544ad2af0935138a5,"Reduce unused allocations when casting UUIDs for Postgres

Using the subscript method `#[]` on a string has several overloads and
rather complex implementation. One of the overloads is the capability to
accept a regular expression and then run a match, then return the
receiver (if it matched) or one of the groups from the MatchData.

The function of the `UUID#cast` method is to cast a UUID to a type and
format acceptable by postgres. Naturally UUIDs are supposed to be
string and of a certain format, but it had been determined that it was
not ideal for the framework to send just any old string to Postgres and
allow the engine to complain when ""foobar"" or """" was sent, being
obviously of the wrong format for a valid UUID. Therefore this code was
written to facilitate the checking, and if it were not of the correct
format, a `nil` would be returned as is conventional in Rails.

Now, the subscript method will allocate one or more strings on a match
and return one of them, based on the index parameter. However, there
is no need for a new string, as a UUID of the correct format is already
such, and so long as the format was verified then the string supplied is
adequate for consumption by the database.

The subscript method also creates a MatchData object which will never be
used, and so must eventually be garbage collected.

Garbage collection indeed. This innocuous method tends to be called
quite a lot, for example if the primary key of a table is a uuid, then
this method will be called. If the foreign key of a relation is a UUID,
once again this method is called. If that foreign key is belonging to
a has_many relationship with dozens of objects, then again dozens of
UUIDs shall be cast to a dup of themselves, and spawn dozens of
MatchData objects, and so on.

So, for users that:
* Use UUIDs as primary keys
* Use Postgres
* Operate on collections of objects

This accomplishes a significant savings in total allocations, and may
save many garbage collections.",hatch-carl,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/6735a0719d43b08a18bb5ea544ad2af0935138a5

    user.avatar.attach(blob)
    user.avatar_attachment.present?  => true
    user.avatar_blob.present?        => false    # Incorrect!

This is a false negative. It happens because after the attachment and blob
are built:

  1. The record already has its `_blob` association loaded, as `nil`
  2. the `::Attachment` is associated with the record but the `::Blob` only gets
    associated with the `::Attachment`, not the record itself

In reality, the blob does in fact exist. We can verify this as follows:

    user.avatar.attach(blob)
    user.avatar_attachment.blob.present?    => true  # Blob does exist!

The fix in this change is to simply assign the `::Blob` when assigning
the `::Attachment`. After this fix is applied, we correctly observe:

    user.avatar.attach(blob)
    user.avatar_attachment.present?  => true
    user.avatar_blob.present?        => true    # Woohoo!

=== Many Attachments

We don't see this issue with `Many` attachments because the `_blob` association
is already loaded as part of attaching more/newer blobs.

f41825809cf3d27f98467bd7bc005e5d6ed94828,"Add Relation#annotate for SQL commenting

This patch has two main portions:

1. Add SQL comment support to Arel via Arel::Nodes::Comment.
2. Implement a Relation#annotate method on top of that.

== Adding SQL comment support

Adds a new Arel::Nodes::Comment node that represents an optional SQL
comment and teachers the relevant visitors how to handle it.

Comment nodes may be added to the basic CRUD statement nodes and set
through any of the four (Select|Insert|Update|Delete)Manager objects.

For example:

    manager = Arel::UpdateManager.new
    manager.table table
    manager.comment(""annotation"")
    manager.to_sql # UPDATE ""users"" /* annotation */

This new node type will be used by ActiveRecord::Relation to enable
query annotation via SQL comments.

== Implementing the Relation#annotate method

Implements `ActiveRecord::Relation#annotate`, which accepts a comment
string that will be appeneded to any queries generated by the relation.

Some examples:

    relation = Post.where(id: 123).annotate(""metadata string"")
    relation.first
    # SELECT ""posts"".* FROM ""posts"" WHERE ""posts"".""id"" = 123
    # LIMIT 1 /* metadata string */

    class Tag < ActiveRecord::Base
      scope :foo_annotated, -> { annotate(""foo"") }
    end
    Tag.foo_annotated.annotate(""bar"").first
    # SELECT ""tags"".* FROM ""tags"" LIMIT 1 /* foo */ /* bar */

Also wires up the plumbing so this works with `#update_all` and
`#delete_all` as well.

This feature is useful for instrumentation and general analysis of
queries generated at runtime.",mattyoho,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/f41825809cf3d27f98467bd7bc005e5d6ed94828

The problem occurred, when a `has one through` association contains
a foreign key (it belongs to the intermediate association).

For example, Comment belongs to Post, Post belongs to Author, and Author
`has_one :first_comment, through: :first_post`.

In this case, the value of the foreign key is comparing with the original
record, and since they are likely different, the association is marked
as changed. So it updates every time when the origin record updates.",Kukunin,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/3da0024db472b5697d4b6f17a9e4edefdf4d6a96

2e117c8a0b1220137d4a4cee577b4237aedf5c8b,"Clarify exists check in logs

The default log messages for Model.exists?, when called from .save
on an object which uses scoped uniqueness validation like:

    class Example < ApplicationRecord
      validates :field, uniqueness: {scope: parent_id}
    end

can result in slightly misleading logs.

An example case:

    ↳ app/controllers/example_controller.rb:23
    (0.2ms)  begin transaction
    ↳ app/controllers/example_controller.rb:39
    Example Exists (0.2ms)  SELECT  1 AS one FROM ""examples"" WHERE ""examples"".""field"" IS NULL AND ""examples"".""parent_id"" = ? LIMIT ?  [[""parent_id"", 123], [""LIMIT"", 1]]
    ↳ app/controllers/example_controller.rb:39
    (0.1ms)  rollback transaction

To me, a Rails newbie, this parsed as the following:

- started the transaction to create a thing
- found that your object exists already!
- so we rolled back the transaction

(even though the actual cause of the transaction is something that happens
after the Exists check.)

All this does is add a question mark to the message, to make it clear in the
log that this is a check, not a confirmation.

This may be kind of silly, but it may save some future goofs by newbs like me.",dgfitch,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/2e117c8a0b1220137d4a4cee577b4237aedf5c8b

* Make ActiveRecord `ConnectionPool.connections` thread-safe.

ConnectionPool documentation is clear on the need to synchronize
access to @connections but also states that public methods do not
require synchronization. Existing code exposed @connections
directly via attr_reader. The fix uses synchronize() to lock
@connections then returns a copy to the caller using Array.dup().

Includes comments on the connections method that thread-safe access
to the connections array does not imply thread-safety of accessing
methods on the actual connections.

Adds a test-case that modifies the pool using a supported method
in one thread  while a second thread accesses pool.connections.
The test fails without this patch.

Docker, it's common to bind-mount the rails root directory in the
running container, so that changes to files are shared between the
container and the host. However, this doesn't work so well with the
pidfile and it's necessary to (remember to) add a '-P' flag to the
'rails server' command line; being able to specify this flag using an
env var would make developing with Rails+Docker a bit simpler.",benthorner,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/2e5ec9a6efc80fd266b974fc50b2775afa73130b

722c45f64110be876d83e7f9a22592aa954886c1,"Omit marshal_dump & _dump from delegate_missing_to

Exclude missing marshal_dump and _dump methods from being delegated to
an object's delegation target via the delegate_missing_to extension.
This avoids unintentionally adding instance variables to an object
during marshallization, should the delegation target be a method which
would otherwise add them.

In current versions of Ruby, a bug exists in the way objects are
marshalled, allowing for instance variables to be added or removed
during marshallization (see https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15968).
This results in a corrupted serialized byte stream, causing an object's
instance variables to ""leak"" into subsequent serialized objects during
demarshallization.

In Rails, this behavior may be triggered when marshalling an object that
uses the delegate_missing_to extension, if the delegation target is a
method which adds or removes instance variables to an object being
marshalled - when calling Marshal.dump(object), Ruby's built in behavior
will check whether the object responds to :marshal_dump or :_dump, which
in turn triggers the delegation target method in the
responds_to_missing? function defined in
activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/module/delegation.rb

While future versions of Ruby will resolve this bug by raising a
RuntimeError, the underlying cause of this error may not be readily
apparent when encountered by Rails developers. By excluding marshal_dump
and _dump from being delegated to an object's target, this commit
eliminates a potential cause of unexpected behavior and/or
RuntimeErrors.

c2cadd2f6de7e573037856379d95e234805c5477,"Fix a button_to documentation example

Fixes an example in `button_to`'s documentation; the description states
`button_to` only takes a symbol for the `method` argument, but an
example just below uses a string.

Passing an all-lowercase string incidentally works, so the example is
technically functional despite being undefined behavior. But passing an
all-uppercase string fails, and this is a pretty common practice when
specifying HTTP methods (e.g. `DELETE`), so I think it's best this
example is put in line with the documentation and converted to use
symbols.

I fell for it myself and tried to pass an all-uppercase string after
seeing the example without reading the options descriptions.

Reproduction steps:

```sh
rails new buttonto
cd buttonto
rails c
> def protect_against_forgery?
>   false
> end
=> :protect_against_forgery?
>  button_to('Destroy', 'http://www.example.com', method: ""delete"", remote: true, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?', disable_with: 'loading...' })
=> ""<form class=\""button_to\"" method=\""post\"" action=\""http://www.example.com\"" data-remote=\""true\""><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""_method\"" value=\""delete\"" /><input data-confirm=\""Are you sure?\"" data-disable-with=\""loading...\"" type=\""submit\"" value=\""Destroy\"" /></form>""

It fixes the problem in propagating return_only_media_type_on_content_type
and fixes the corresponding test being ineffective.

The mentioned test addes the following line:
...config.action_dispatch.return_only_media_type_on_content_type = true
to the config and checks if it takes effect. However, in this scenario,
the value is already true before this line.
Moreover, the users are supposed to flip this from true to false in real
situations.

This commit flips the config in the test, making it to fail as
expected. The next commit will fix the failure.

In order for return_only_media_type_on_content_type to appropriately
take effect on ActionDispatch::Response, we want to know when
ActionDispatch::Response is loaded.
As load hooks for ActionDispatch would be too broad, the appropriate
registry is for ActionDispatch::Response itself.

Fixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/28827.

The steps to reproduce are as follows:

git clone git@github.com:bbuchalter/rails-issue-28827.git
cd rails-issue-28827
bundle install
bin/rails db:create

Observe that we create two databases when invoking db:create: development and test. Now observe what happens when we invoke our drop command while using DATABASE_URL.

DATABASE_URL=sqlite3://$(pwd)/db/database_url.sqlite3 bin/rails db:create

As expected, the development environment now uses the DATABASE_URL. What is unexpected is that the test environment does not.

It's unclear what the expected behavior should be in this case, but the cause of it is this: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9f2c74eda07ea5a9e4e624d5575a717714088dbf/activerecord/lib/active_record/tasks/database_tasks.rb#L494

Because of each_local_configuration, there seems to be no way invoke these database rake on only the development environment to ensure DATABASE_URL is respected.

9aa59f9d4aa88478c03f323ae7730059fd1d0ff5,"Avoid extraneous preloading when loading across `has_one` associations

The Preloader relies on other objects to bind the retrieved records to their
parents. When executed across a hash, it assumes that the results of
`preloaded_records` is the appropriate set of records to pass in to the next
layer.

Filtering based on the reflection properties in `preloaded_records` allows us to
avoid excessive preloading in the instance where we are loading across a
`has_one` association distinguished by an order (e.g. ""last comment"" or
similar), by dropping these records before they are returned to the
Preloader. In this situation, we avoid potentially very long key lists in
generated queries and the consequential AR object instantiations.

This is mostly relevant if the underlying linked set has relatively many
records, because this is effectively a multiplier on the number of records
returned on the far side of the preload. Unfortunately, avoiding the
over-retrieval of the `has_one` association seems to require substantial changes
to the preloader design, and probably adaptor-specific logic -- it is a
top-by-group problem.",mkrfowler,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/9aa59f9d4aa88478c03f323ae7730059fd1d0ff5

indexes in a table.

Currently the pg_class catalog is filtered out to retrieve the indexes in a
table by its relkind value. Which in versions lower than 11 of PostgreSQL
is always `i` (lower case). But since version 11, PostgreSQL
supports partitioned indexes referenced with a relkind value of `I`
(upper case). This makes any feature within the current code base to exclude those
partitioned indexes.

The solution proposed is to make use of the `IN` clause to filter those
relkind values of `i` and/or `I` when retrieving a table indexes.",sebastian-palma,https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/git/commits/db6eb846eb6340ee5ece08c84717d7fc56df34c0

When working through an issue, I found myself a little confused stumbling upon some code like this:

```rb
cookies[...] = {
  # ...
  domain: %w(.site.io .site.com)
}
```

In my mind I was thinking ""is this some weird part of the cookie spec? or is this Rails?"" and the docs didn't offer much insight into how it works. Going back into the commit where that line was added, the folks who added it were confused to until someone linked to the source.

I figured that clarifying this in the docs would be useful. Of course, people should know how cookies work before fiddling with them (unlike me), but since cookies are so sensitive, I think the docs should opt for being explicit about this.

8d57457fb8344b956ceeca765ab6a45517bfed13,"Fix load_additional_types handling of large OIDs

In Postgres, OIDs are *unsigned* 4 byte integers. Postgres allows
casting oids to integers so that you can have access to more operators;
however, doing this could lead to some issues if the oids are very large
as they might around to the negative number range.

From the Postgres docs:

> The oid type itself has few operations beyond comparison. It can be
> cast to integer, however, and then manipulated using the standard
> integer operators. (Beware of possible signed-versus-unsigned
> confusion if you do this.)

In most real-world databases this is never going to be a problem. In
order to reach the overflow, you have to have 2,147,483,648 objects in
your database (not rows, but relations, types, views, etc.). In extreme
cases though it is possible to reach that number and encounter some
buggy behavior.
